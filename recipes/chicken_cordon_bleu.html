                    <p>A cordob bleu is a dish that traditionally consists of meat wrapped
                        <br>around cheese, then breaded and pan-fried or deep-fried. Many modern versions
                        <br>of the classic French recipe, such as this one, are baked.

                        </p>

                        <p>Classic chicken cordon bleu is made with the following ingredients:
                            <br>chicken cutlets, cooked ham, Swiss cheese, bread crumbs, and simple
                            <br>spices. It`s usually topped with a rich cream sauce spiked with a hint of Dijon mustard.
                            <br> <strong>"Cordon Bleu"</strong> translates to <em>"blue ribbon"</em>.
